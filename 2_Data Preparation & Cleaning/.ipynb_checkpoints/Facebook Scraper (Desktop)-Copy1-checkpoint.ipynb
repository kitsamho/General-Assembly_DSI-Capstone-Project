    "The ideal (i.e easiest!) way of obtaining Facebook page data is through the Facebook Graph API. However, ever since the Cambridge Analytica debacle, Facebook have severely limited developers’ access to page data for brands. In my initial proposal I suggested three strategies to obtain Facebook page data: \n",
    "\n",
    "    -Use the Graph API through Facebook\n",
    "    -Use some web scraping/parsing script\n",
    "    -Using a pre existing data set from Kaggle or another data set repository\n",
    "\n",
    "I decided to proceed with strategy 2 and use Selenium to write a script that would in effect ‘navigate’ Facebook like a user, scraping the data from each post on any given brands Facebook page.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using Selenium\n",
    "\n",
    "Having experimented with Facebook.com, I found out quite quickly that I got logged out several times. I suspect Facebook is fairly tuned to any behaviour that looks vaguely ‘robotic’. Fortunately ‘mobile.facebook.com’ proved to be far easier to manipulate.\n",
    "\n",
    "My main aim was to obtain the following data from each post:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -Post content (i.e. the copy of the post)\n",
    "    -The date post was made\n",
    "    -The number of comments \n",
    "    -The number of responses overall\n",
    "    -The number of responses broken down by emotion (likes, love, wow, angry, sad, haha)\n",
    "    -The number of shares\n",
    "    -The type of post i.e. (status update, photo, video, poll)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Challenge #1 – logging in\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to capture share information you have to be logged in to Facebook, so my script had to be able to log in as a user. I found that I had to modify the script to anticipate multiple log-in screens, in multiple formats – which was very challenging. Fortunately the script is fairly water tight now and can log in successfully almost every time. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Challenge #2 – analysis of responses broken down by emotion\n",
    "\n",
    "I could easily scrape the total number of interactions (an aggregate of like, love, haha etc.) however scraping the breakdown currently is still something I’m looking at. The ids used by these are the same across the emotions and there is no emotion specific label to scrape so it’s currently impossible to differentiate between a ‘like’ or a ‘haha’ for example. I’m currently working out strategies to get around this.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Challenge #3 – (mildly) limited posts to scrape\n",
    "\n",
    "There seems to be a limit to how many retrospective posts that are accessible on Facebook. I was initially hoping to find years and years worth of data however I need to manage my expectations on this as I have found Facebook doesn’t tend to go back more than a year for any one brand. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of these challenges, I have slightly evolved my initial aim.\n",
    "\n",
    "I initially wanted to try and predict *what type of social content results in greater engagement on one brands Facebook page*. Given that I might struggle to get detailed emotional breakdown and that I have slightly limited data for any one brand, I will look to include a secondary aim:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional objective:\n",
    "\n",
    "Can a machine learning classification model learn to differentiate between the social content of the main UK supermarket brands?\n",
    "\n",
    "The commercial implications of this analysis are interesting. If the experimental hypothesis is verified i.e. there is a genuine difference in the social content between all the supermarket brands in the UK (which a classifier will be able to identify with a high degree of accuracy) then the various brand managers and marketing teams are doing a good job! However if the null hypothesis is confirmed – and there is no observable difference in the social content of all the main brands then this is problematic. A key aspect of being a healthy brand is being a differentiated brand. It will also be interesting to explore the distribution of precision and recall - are more premium/economy brands more likely to be misclassified as other premium/economy brands?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data to obtain:\n",
    "\n",
    "I’ve chosen a range of UK super markets; a mixture of higher end and lower end. I’ve also chosen brands that are fairly active on Facebook and have a reasonable number of engaged users. The following brands have been scraped:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -Sainsburys\n",
    "    -Tesco \n",
    "    -Waitrose\n",
    "    -M&S\n",
    "    -Morrisons\n",
    "    -Lidl\n",
    "    -ASDA\n"
