12,"Colleagues at our Hyde store were touched to receive a letter from pensioner Jean thanking our home shopping driver Arthur for his help when she collapsed at home.
Jean, who's 84, had passed out shortly before Arthur arrived with her shopping. Although she told Arthur she was fine he stayed with her to unpack her shopping and make sure she was all right. Jean was admitted to hospital and has since made a good recovery – and one of the first things she did after she came home was to write to the store to say how much she appreciated Arthur's help. Jean said: ""I just thought how nice that a young man should be so caring. It just moved me. All the Asda drivers are nice but he was exceptionally nice.""

She remembered chatting to four-year-old Patrick the previous day when he came into the store with his dad and told her he was looking after his school’s stuffed toy for the weekend. She didn’t know how to get in touch with the family so she posted photos of Foxy having fun ""working"" in the store – and luckily Patrick’s mum saw them. Patrick was reunited with Foxy at the store – and had a fantastic story to tell in Foxy’s journal when he took him back to school.
